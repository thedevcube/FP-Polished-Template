# First person template (Godot)
This is a template for first person games made in godot, originally i'd use it on a game but i no longer wanted to develop it so i decided
to leave this public for everyone to see.

# Content:
- Smooth WASD movement
- Smooth camera movement
- Fall impact animations
  - Light impact: When the player falls from a not so high place the camera stumbles a little - Enabled after 2 seconds of air time
  - Impact: When the player falls from a high place the player's control are disabled and an animation of impact is played - Enabled after 5 seconds of airtime
  - Both of those plays an "aiaiai" sound - This is a joke a friend told me to put there, feel free to replace it.
- A movement guide text - Informing how to move, crouch, sprint.

# Disclaimer:
I am NOT an GDscript expert and the code may not be optimized, feel free to change it as you want.

# Anyway
Have fun :)
